                    Artour is the brainchild of a group of hoteliers who had
                    realised that external hotel services available to guests
                    at reception is an area that could be better-managed and
                    made more efficient in a way that allows the guest to access
                    all services available to them via the hotel receptionist,
                    whilst simultaneously enabling the hotel manager to turn their
                    hotel into a one-stop-shop for any and all other services it offers.

                    We aim to create a network of businesses that will collaborate
                    with maximum efficiency and full transparency, using simple,
                    easy-to-operate technology. Our goal is to make the receptionistâ€™s
                    job that much more efficient. To that end, we have set up a platform
                    that connects businesses and hotel guests via hotel receptionists.
                    The platform bands together the sum total of services available
                    to the visitor in a simple, efficient manner.
